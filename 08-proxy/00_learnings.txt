Proxies can offer a good way to separate out security
Proxy handles security
Underlying entity handles everything else

Proxy pattern also good for implementing networks calls / remote procedure calls
The proxy handles the request and returns the response,
allowing the separation of concerns around networking

By overriding #method_missing and using #send proxies implemented in Ruby can be kept very short.
