I got the example to work by assigning the subtasks after initiliastion that way if they need to removed you can pass in a variable.
Otherwise #remove_sub_tasks needs to be modified e.g. look for and remove instances of that class

The operators stuff is also quite cool but I think I would find having actual method names more readable.
